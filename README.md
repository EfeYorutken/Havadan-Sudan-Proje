## Description

Understanding the behaviours of fluids and utilising them for the development of technology is vital in many sectors. Planes and space exploration rely on atmospheric phenomena to generate lift. Vehicles, trains, and ships need to be optimised for the least possible drag to achieve higher efficiency and increase economic profitability. In medicine, heart valve surgery includes designing custom artificial valves for patients, and the design requires modelling the blood flow of the patient. Natural events, weather, and climate change predictions are only possible with a sufficiently accurate model of fluids. While the physical laws governing the behaviour of fluids are well developed, solving the partial differential equations by hand is often times difficult or impossible.



To overcome this challenge, the partial differential systems are solved numerically using computer systems. This practice is called computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and is widely adopted. However, the computation requirements of these simulations require state-of-the-art computing systems, and the accuracy of these simulations is not satisfactory for many high-end users. Developing different CFD algorithms with better accuracy and less computational complexity is a hot research topic. This project proposes to implement a Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) algorithm to simulate fluids in a many-gpu supercomputer system. LBM is a recent algorithm with increasing popularity with the potential of higher accuracy and lower computational requirements while being suitable for parallel computation. The project includes a desktop application and user interface to create fluid dynamics simulations and examine the resulting lift, drag, fluid velocity, pressure, and temperature fields by an expert user, potentially using them in an engineering or scientific application.
