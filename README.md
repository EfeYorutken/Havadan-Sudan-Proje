## Description

Understanding the behaviours of fluids and utilizing it for development of technology
is vital in many sectors. Planes and space exploration relies on atmospheric phenomena
to generate lift. Vehicles, trains and ships need to be optimized for least possible
drag to achieve higher efficiency and increase economic profitablity. In medicine,
 heart valve surgery includes designing custom artificial valves for patients and
 the design requires modeling blood flow of the patient. Natural events, weather
 and climiate change predictions are only possible with a sufficiently accurate
 model of fluids. While the phsical laws governing behaviour of fluids are well developed
 , solving the partial differential equations by hand is often times difficult or impossible.

To overcome this challange, the partial differential systems are solved numerically
using computer systems. This practice is called computational fluid dynamics (CFD)
and is widely adopted. However the computation requirements of these simulations
requires state of the art computing systems and accuracy of these simulations are
not satisfactory for many high-end users. Developing different CFD algorithms with
better accuracy and less computational complexity is a hot research topic. This
project proposes to implement a Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) algorithm to simulate
fluids in a many-gpu super computer system. LBM is a recent algorithm with increasing
popularity with the potantial of higher accuracy and lower computational requirements
while being suitable for parallel computation. The project includes a desktop application
and user interface to create fluid dynamics simulations and examine the resulting
lift, drag, fluid velocity, pressure, and temperature fields by an expert user potantially
to use them in an engineering  or scientific application.
